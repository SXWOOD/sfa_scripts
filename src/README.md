Scripting for Animation Assignment 2. Develop a SceneFile class that is able to create a standardized filenaming convention.


I originally had different individual files of the scenefile.py saved on my desktop that I created after watching each video and they were titled scenefile_v1 through scenefile_v4. After rereading the assignment rubric I noticed that the SRC folder on my Github needed to have only one scenefile.py file with different commits after each video, so I was able to update my scenefile and duplicate the code from the files on my desktop. That is why the commits I made are only a few minutes apart.
