I had to transfer my older scenefile code from my laptop to my desktop, and after reuploading it to a new GitHub
repository, it deleted my repository history. I saved each stage of my progress as separate files and updated my
new code, which is why my changes are only a few minutes apart again.

I also saved this project as an entirely new repository called "SmartSave", I thought we needed a different one for 
each assignment. My assignment 2 code can be found at https://github.com/SXWOOD/sfa_scripts. After this project, 
I'll be submitting my future assignments into the sfa_scripts repository unless instructed otherwise.

I apologize for making these mistakes, I'll be making sure that this won't happen again on my next projects.
